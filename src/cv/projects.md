Personal Projects
------------------

   * [Spock](http://github.com/mattvonrocketstein/spock/) is a library I made for playing around with logic in python and also includes improvements I've made to the python [AI:MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach) library.  The improvements fall into a few main categories: adding missing tests, improving the code to more idiomatically pythonic, and in a few cases adding missing features.

   * [Smash](http://mattvonrocketstein.github.io/smash/) is an experimental command line shell for replacing bash with a hybrid system shell/python environment.  It is based on IPython

* [Tunl](http://mattvonrocketstein.github.io/tunl/) is a library and command-line utility for managing ssh tunnels on posix systems.  It's not super complicated, but it is documented, tested, and available on PyPi.

  * [Ymir](https://github.com/mattvonrocketstein/ymir) is a command-line devops utility/library for describing and deploying services on EC2.  In many respects it is similar to [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and I wrote this mainly to learn more about puppet and fabric.

  * [My website](http://data.holdings/books) is a MongoDB-backed flask application hosted on EC2.  Check out the integration with the Github and Google+ APIs [here](http://data.holdings/code) and [here](http://data.holdings/pix), respectively.  Behind the scenes I'm using it to experiment with ansible, elasticsearch, and the ELK stack.

Code Samples
-------------

  * Check out the `projects` section for complicated stuff that demonstrates documentation and unittests.  This section is for simpler snippets.

  * [simple command line tool](https://gist.github.com/mattvonrocketstein/6ebfd94b06b25cc74910) for talking to datadog

  * a [metaprogramming example](https://gist.github.com/mattvonrocketstein/76d6b96d536d2c8ef991) that demonstrates some advanced knowledge of the python language

  * I have a few random patches in the open source world, one in IPython [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6885/files) and one in jenkinsapi [here](https://github.com/salimfadhley/jenkinsapi/pull/360)

Live Demos
-----------

* Interested employers and you can probably see the guts of [my builbot](http://data.holdings/jenkins).

  * As a telecommuter, I've often recorded videos for feature demonstration, later training for content producers, and as a preliminary guide for other developers prior to handling documentation.  Interested employers can probably obtain samples.

  * See the `project` section of this page for a link to my webpage.
