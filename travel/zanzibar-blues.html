<p>Walking mornings, down the beach and down the dirty cobblestones of side streets near the port where the sun is rising, the birds calling and everything smells of brine. Pass the market where the fishmongers are calling, squid guts glinting in gutters, wild cats encased in the fish muck yowling and prowling.  Men are stretching morning stretches and cughing morning coughs, making ready the lines for another day’s work in the boats.</p>
<p>Walking mornings, walking and squinting against the big hot eye that’s opening in that big blue sky, walking vaguely in search of that hot cup of coffee which will lose so much of it’s appeal after the heat of the day falls on Zanzibar like big humid hammer.  Walking away from the beach and towards the center, from which is now rising an incredible noise.</p>
<p>From starboard and aft, the call to prayer is being raised up like a sail, both sides perfectly in sync but at very different volumes.   Portside, there is another mosque somewhere with a very different voice saying the same words, but completely out of sync.  Above and beyond the 3 dimensionality of this noise, here comes a new sound rising up and out, the obnoxious noise of what actually sounds like an air raid siren!  Smaller, more muted bursts of sound: engines farting and dropped pans from a kitchen and what must be swearing.  Suddenly from around a corner, an energetic and very animated conversation, incomprehensible, but nevertheless clearly recognizable with the all the rhythms and contours representing earnest bargaining.</p>
<p>Behold a building at least 200 years old, cracked and faded and probably last painted in the first half of it’s life.  Evidently starting to feel it’s age in other ways too, because it sits leaning and is propped up against it’s neighbor with half a dozen telephone poles cemented directly into a pedestrian byway.  Me ducking under the impromptu support structure, and still looking for that hot drink before the heat of the day begins.</p>
<p>A open cafe before 8 AM may present an obstacle, if you’re looking for tourist establishments. Fortunately the mosques wake up long before the rest of the city, and most have a vendor outside where you can buy biscuits and coffee.  Shuffe past the growing crowd and up towards the kettle, removing sunglasses and offering up a few coins. Greet the vendor in Arabic instead of Swahili, receive a few shillings of change and sit, waiting, for coffee to cool.
Drinking and thinking like:  Christ, did I really almost get in a knife fight last night?  Most tourists probably scare easy and would just start throwing money at the mention of a knife, regardless of whether the assailant really had one — but I visited Zanzibar shortly after leaving South Africa, and I carried a knife myself whenever I thought I’d be out late.  If he hadn’t been standing so closeA fellow mentioning he has a knife make me think of using mine, and even if he probably is bluffing.. who wants to be the one to move second in a knife fight, I ask you?</p>
<p>Last night you drank deeply among friends and foes and beers and nameless bottles, nameless, all nameless or with names that do not withstand the test of time, or even, for that matter a few short hours.  You drank with friends and fools, tourists and tramps, you loved them all, hated them all, alternately enthralled or bored; binging on booze is always a tedious and tumultuous affair.  You, you sat stinking, rank and reeling and neverminding the telemetry.  Did we speak of maths, physics?  My god we did!, Bernoulli, sure, but to what end!?  Foreigners and princes, we stuttered stupid, struck dumb by drink.  Nevertheless conversing about entropy and heat death of the universe, are you fucking kidding me?  At some point the mathematics of the moment chafed.. a preamble to poetry.  “Yes, but have you read Keats or Yeats or Auden or Eliot”, I read it all and for what?  Fools: what are words to me when me and mine have faces that turn back the wind and the rain no different than the stone.
So we sat stinking, each threatening to think harder or further than the other, nicotine needs curling in the tips of our fingers and then reaching for another nail in the old coffin.  With jazz and jangled nerves there where sound of surf served as stanza, all these poignant poems no one would remember.
I met a lady, past her prime, Malibu model washed up and washed out.  You thought you should be listened to, first and foremost, regardless of what was said.  No, I do understand: time is cruel to us all, makeup and voice-coaches notwithanding.  On the other hand: Evolve or die.  (She knew enough to know she needed to know something to say something, but thought a name would be enough. Yes, yes… Matisse, or Eliot, or Einstein, but tell me what it means to you?)
I met a man, a soldier turned mercenary, solemn and stupid and silly as hell.  We drank and you said adventure had burned you out, that perhaps you were ready, at last, to live the life of the mind.  The time for soldiering was over, and now was a fine time for physics, philosophy, literature, love, and life!  But part of loving life was loving money, and so you went where the pay was, nevermind your daughter.
I met a lady,</p>
