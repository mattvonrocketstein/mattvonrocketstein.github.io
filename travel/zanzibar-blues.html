<p>Walking mornings, down the beach and down the dirty cobblestones of side streets near the port where the sun is rising, the birds are calling, and everything smells of brine past the market where the fishmongers are calling, where squid guts are glinting in gutters, where wild cats are encased in the fish muck, yowling and prowling.  Men are stretching morning stretches and coughing their morning coughs, making ready the lines for another day’s work in the boats.</p>
<p>Walking mornings, walking and already squinting against the big hot eye that’s opening in that big blue sky, walking vaguely in search of that hot cup of coffee which will lose so much of it’s appeal after the heat of the day falls on Zanzibar like big humid hammer.  Walking away from the beach and towards the center, from which is now rising an incredible noise.</p>
<p>From starboard and aft the call to prayer is being raised up like a sail, and while the left and the right sides the noise is perfectly in sync but at very different volumes.   Portside, there is another mosque somewhere with a very different voice saying the same words, but completely out of sync.  Above and beyond the 3-dimensionality of that noise, here comes a new sound rising up and out, the obnoxious noise of what actually sounds like an air raid siren!  There are smaller, more muted bursts of sound: engines farting and dropped pans from a kitchen followed by what can only be swearing.  From around a corner the sound of an energetic and very animated conversation, incomprehensible, but nevertheless clearly recognizable with the all the rhythms and contours that represent shrewd bargaining begun in earnest.</p>
<p>Here's a structure at least 200 years old, cracked and faded and probably last painted in the first half of it’s life.  Suppose that David Livingstone presumed to study his maps in this very building, before he set off to find the origin of the Nile.  Just as Livingstone left his heart in Africa, this building must have left most of its strength somewhere in the past because it sits leaning and is propped up against it’s neighbor with half a dozen telephone poles cemented directly into a pedestrian walkway.  Me ducking under the impromptu support structure, and still looking for that hot drink before the heat of the day begins.</p>
<p>A open cafe before 8 AM presents an obstacle if you’re looking for the strong, brewed coffee tourists usually expect.  Fortunately for me, the mosques wake up long before the rest of the city, and most have a vendor outside where you can buy biscuits and coffee.  I shuffle past the growing crowd and up towards the kettle, removing sunglasses and offering up a few coins. I greet the vendor in bad Arabic instead of Swahili out of respect, sort of acknowledging the obvious fact that I'm out of place here.  I receive a few shillings of change and sit waiting for coffee to cool.</p>

I'm struggling with a hangover and start to think over last night.  It seems to me I drank deeply among friends and foes and beers and nameless endless bottles.  Did I almost get in a knife fight on the way home?  He probably didn't really have one, but in that case he shouldn't have mentioned it because I actually did!  Who wants to be second to make a move in that situation?  I drank too much with friendly fools, tourists and tramps, and I loved them all, hated them all, alternately enthralled or bored.  Binging on booze is a tedious and tumultuous affair.  

We all bellied up to the bar and sat stinking, rank and reeling and neverminding the telemetry of origin vectors.  Did we speak of maths, physics?  My god we did!, Bernoulli, sure, but to what end!?  Foreigners and princes all, spooks and grifters and aged expatriates bumbling at the brink of expiration despite the endless fine weather.  We stuttered stupid, struck dumb by drink.  Nevertheless conversing about entropy and the heat death of the universe, are you fucking kidding me?  It was all so unlikely.  At some point the mathematics of the moment chafed, we agreed it was only a preamble to poetry.  “Yes, but have you read Keats or Yeats or Auden or Eliot”, agreed we read it all and for what?  What are words to us when me and mine all have faces that turn back the wind and the rain no different than the stone.

So we sat stinking, each threatening to think harder or further than the other, nicotine need curling in the tips of famished fingers as they reached for another nail in the old coffin.  With jazz and jangled nerves on bleak moonlit beaches where sound of surf served as stanza, we spoke all these poignant poems that no one would remember.

<hr style="border-top: dotted 2px;" />

I met a man, a prince in pain, who owned the bottle and the table and the bar and the beach.  He started drinking early and often because it was his custom, and I opened and closed his bar day after day too, partly for the bandwidth and partly for the conversation.  He was a fiend for physics with algebra trouble, a cynic and shameless pimp and a excellent artist and a poet and an aimless alcoholic beach bum, self important, successful and unashamed to be propped up on the family money.  Did you publish that poetry, or finally start work as an engineer?

I met a man, a soldier turned mercenary, solemn and stupid and silly as hell, but well-traveled, well-spoken, the solid earthy backbone of our unlikely conference that wore his scars for his wisdom.  We drank and he said adventure had burned him out, that perhaps he was ready, at last, to live the life of the mind.  Perhaps the time for soldiering was over, and now was a fine time for physics, philosophy, literature, love, and life!  But part of loving life was loving money, and so he always went where the pay was, nevermind your daughter.  When and where did you learn to play the saxophone?

I met a lady, past her prime, some Malibu model washed up and washed out.  Still accustomed to having beauty that was gone, was so convinced she should be listened to, first and foremost, regardless of what was said.  No, truly, we all *do* understand: time is cruel to us all, makeup and voice-coaches notwithstanding.  On the other, crueler hand, the room's elephant wondered why you expected the world to change when you refused to.  The table agreed, it was supremely frustrating to be around someone who knew enough to know they needed to know something to say something, but then thought a name would be enough. Yes, yes… Matisse, or Eliot, or Einstein, but tell us how you know their names and what it all means to you?

I met a man, a nearly incoherent tramp, so long in drink he didn't know his own lies from the story of his life.  To one up the solider you fought in wars you were too young to remember, but I feel sure it's true you spoke five languages and had always gone to anywhere the wind would blow you.  And you, a dirty delinquent and confirmed charity case, insisted soberly that every question from the unwashed to the wise was like the knock of the beggar man, not to be heeded.  Where you taught your nihilism in the same place where you memorized all those works of Shakespeare?
