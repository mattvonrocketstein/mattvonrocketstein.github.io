### About this document

This document is motivated by the fact that there's a lot of noise out there about "work / life balance" these days, and at least *some* remote work is rapidly becoming the norm in different fields for many reasons.  Sadly, how to obtain or negotiate telecommuting time is outside the scope of this document.. so if you're reading this you should probably already have a plan for that part.

What *is* in scope for this guide?  Well, it's primarily aimed at digital nomads with an above average sense of adventure who are very mobile indeed.  If your goal is just to move to the other side of the world but stay in one place after you get there, then rest of this document may not interest you.  I will try to cover stuff like this:

  * different ways to move
  * various enabling technology and gear,
  * observations on levels of connectivity in different parts of the world,
  * brief discussion about how to choose a destination.

###What kind of adventure telecommuter are you?

Some telecommuting work may have a set duration, other work may have indefinite duration.  You might have a flexible schedule or you might have to ensure availability during all standard business hours.  A tour is still doable under any of these circumstances but you'll have to know what you're in for.  The major considerations are:

  * degree of "connectedness": do you need internet and or phone service at all times?
  * level of self reliance: do you want to camp or live in hotels?

If you want to live in hotels,  and For the teletourer or short rides with hotel and hostel stays)

###High levels of self-reliance (Bike-packing, expedition touring)

If you want to travel on the cheap or you just like camping, *bikepacking* is a solid option.  You'll want *standard camping gear*, which is as light as possible, plus whatever you need for handling your work with a *mobile power* setup.

Obviously the more prior experience the better, but if you're particularly adventurous you can do it with almost zero prior experience.  This document is aimed at people with no prior experience, but think of it as supplement for [a beginners course](http://www.stepperiders.mn/solo-cross-country-horse-trekking-in-mongolia/).  Note that depending on your route and the time of year, [backcountry camping/navigation skills](#) may actually be much more important than prior equestrian experience.  Regardless of your experience level, you really ought to buy a short-term insurance policy which covers some kind of evacuation expenses as well as horse riding.  See for example the [world nomads adventure sports](http://www2.worldnomads.com/travel-insurance/adventure-sports-benefits.aspx?p=60272c78d7464f6faac3025a4daa4549&c=USA) policy.
