### About this document

This document is motivated by the fact that there's a lot of noise out there about "work / life balance" these days, and at least *some* remote work is rapidly becoming the norm in different fields for many reasons.  Sadly, how to obtain or negotiate telecommuting time is outside the scope of this document.. so if you're reading this you should probably already have a plan for that part.

What *is* in scope for this guide?  Well, it's primarily aimed at digital nomads with an above average sense of adventure who are very mobile indeed.  If your goal is just to move to the other side of the world but stay in one place after you get there, then rest of this document may not interest you.  I will try to cover stuff like this:

  * different ways to move
  * various enabling technology and gear,
  * observations on levels of connectivity in different parts of the world,
  * brief discussion about how to choose a destination.

###About teletouring

Teletouring as used in this document is just shorthand for "bicycle touring as a telecommuter".  A never-ending bicycle tour is a great option for the digital nomad for several reasons, but primarily because it's cheap, healthy, and exciting, offering a totally new perspective on travel than even the most seasoned vagabond will otherwise encounter.

There's also the important fact that you can cary tons of stuff, which will open up a whole new world for you if you're used to traveling light.  Even if you're an experienced road-warrior who travels with a laptop AND a tent, did you ever regret that you can't fit a camping stove into your carry-on luggage?
