  My personal website is a simple python app built on top of flask and mongo for persisting a few simple models.  See for example a list of [books I've read](http://data.holdings/books).  It also [integrates with the Goole+ API](http://data.holdings/pix) for tracking my photography and uses the [the Github API](http://data.holdings/code) for tracking my code.
